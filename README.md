# ubuntu(desktop): Development release feedback

Welcome to the Ubuntu (Desktop) Development Release Feedback and early enablement repository. Your thoughts, opinions, and feedback are valuable for the growth and success of Ubuntu Desktop so thank you for your participation üôè

## Background

While technical issues or bugs concerning Ubuntu Desktop can be reported through various channels like Launchpad, GitLab, GitHub, these platforms present a barrier for some users. Furthermore, there are limited channels to provide feedback regarding the user experience, a critical aspect of desktop development. This repository aims to bridge that gap and invite more comprehensive, diverse input from our user base.

Additionally, each development series has changes that typically don't land until certain packages are included in the main archive. To avoid these changes landed late in the cycle, and missing feedback from early testers, this repository provides `scripts/*` so that users can apply these changes early in the cycle.

## Why Your Feedback is Important

User feedback is an essential part of software development. It helps the developers understand how users interact with the software, what problems they encounter, and what improvements they desire. Your feedback will contribute directly to making Ubuntu Desktop better with each development cycle.

## How to Provide Feedback

Simply create a new issue in this repository. We ask that you try to be as detailed as possible, providing specific information about what you liked, what you didn't, and any suggestions for improvement you might have. Please follow the provided issue template for optimal results.

For those who want to go the extra mile checkout [scripts/README.md](./scripts/README.md) to see how you can apply even more cutting edge changes.

## Code of Conduct

This repository adheres to Ubuntu's [Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct). Please ensure your interactions respect the guidelines outlined therein.
